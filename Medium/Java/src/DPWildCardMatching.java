/**
 * Wild Card Matching
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/discuss/17812/My-java-DP-solution-using-2D-table.
 *
 * Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.
 *
 * '?' Matches any single character.
 * '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
 * The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
 * p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like ? or *.
